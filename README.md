# SECURITY IN AI 
# PS-214 : DEEPFAKE DETECTION

# Mirage.AI

Check out **Mirage.AI**, a groundbreaking solution combating the rising threat of deepfake manipulation in visual media! Developed during the Aeravat AI Hackathon at SPIT, organized by IEEE Bombay Section, Mirage.AI emerged as the First Runner Up!

üöÄ Spearheaded by our team, **Mirage.AI** leverages cutting-edge AI technologies like TensorFlow, MTCNN, and VGG-16 to accurately identify manipulated content across images, audio, and videos.

üí° Orchestrating the integration of these advanced deep learning models, we designed a user-friendly Web App using Next.js and Python. This intuitive platform provides real-time deepfake detection functionalities, enhancing cybersecurity measures.

ü§ù Collaborating closely with our talented team members from the CSE (ICB) department of Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering (Rena Shah TE, Malhar Bonde TE, Hetvi Lodaya TE, and Bhargav Pandit SE), we curated diverse datasets, preprocessed data, and trained models to ensure robust detection performance and generalization ability.
